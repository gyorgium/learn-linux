As with other Linux distributions, Kali Linux is organized to be consistent with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), allowing users of other Linux distributions to easily find their way around Kali. The FHS defines the purpose of each directory. The top-level directories are described as follows.

	/bin/: basic programs
	/boot/: Kali Linux kernel and other files required for its early boot process
	/dev/: device files
	/etc/: configuration files
	/home/: user's personal files
	/lib/: basic libraries
	/media/: mount points for removable devices (CD/DVD-ROM, USB keys, and so on)
	/mnt/: temporary mount point
	/opt/: extra applications provided by third parties
	/root/: administrator's (root's) personal files
	/run/: volatile runtime data that does not persist across reboots (not yet included in the FHS)
	/sbin/: system programs
	/srv/: data used by servers hosted on this system
	/tmp/: temporary files (this directory is often emptied at boot)
	/usr/: applications (this directory is further subdivided into bin, sbin, lib according to the same logic as in the root directory) Furthermore, /usr/share/ contains architecture-independent data. The /usr/local/ directory is meant to be used by the administrator for installing applications manually without overwriting files handled by the packaging system (dpkg).
	/var/: variable data handled by services. This includes log files, queues, spools, and caches.
	/proc/ and /sys/ are specific to the Linux kernel (and not part of the FHS). They are used by the kernel for exporting data to user space.


The kernel exports data about detected hardware through the /proc/ and /sys/ virtual file systems. Applications often access devices by way of files created within /dev/. Specific files represent disk drives (for instance, /dev/sda), partitions (/dev/sda1), mice (/dev/input/mouse0), keyboards (/dev/input/event0), sound cards (/dev/snd/*), serial ports (/dev/ttyS*), and other components.e

The shell executes each command by running the first program of the given name that it finds in a directory listed in the PATH environment variable. Most often, these programs are in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin. For example, the ls command is found in /bin/ls; the which command reports the location of a given executable. Sometimes the command is directly handled by the shell, in which case, it is called a shell built-in command (cd and pwd are among those); the type command lets you query the type of each command.

These variables can be defined system-wide in /etc/profile or per-user in ~/.profile but variables that are not specific to command line interpreters are better put in /etc/environment, since those variables will be injected into all user sessions thanks to a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) â€“ even when no shell is executed.
